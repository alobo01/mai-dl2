# This is a Hydra multirun configuration, not a separate file usually.
# It's used on the command line with `python -m src.train -m ...`
# Example command for sweeping:
# python -m src.train -m \
#   model.backbone.name=resnet50,vit_b16 \
#   model.osr_head.type=energy,kplus1 \
#   train.optimizer.lr=1e-3,1e-4 \
#   +experiment=cifar10_resnet50_energy # Base experiment to inherit from, if any

# If you want to define a sweep in a YAML file for Hydra to pick up,
# you might create a custom launcher or use a more advanced setup.
# The basic Hydra multirun is via CLI arguments as above.

# For a structured sweep definition file (e.g. if using Optuna sweeper plugin for Hydra):
# defaults:
#   - override hydra/sweeper: optuna # Example for Optuna
# 
# hydra:
#   sweeper:
#     study_name: osr_optimization
#     direction: maximize
#     n_trials: 50
#     sampler:
#       _target_: optuna.samplers.TPESampler
#       seed: 123
#     params:
#       model.d_embed: choice(256, 512, 1024)
#       train.optimizer.lr: interval(0.00001, 0.001) # loguniform(1e-5, 1e-3) with older Optuna/Hydra
#       model.backbone.name: choice("resnet50", "efficientnet_b4")
#       model.osr_head.type: choice("energy", "kplus1")

# The prompt's sweep.yaml seems more like a placeholder for where such a config would go.
# The provided example `python -m src.train -m model.backbone=resnet50,vit_b16 ...` is the standard Hydra way.
# So, this file could just contain a comment explaining how to sweep.
